## Process

Major components of gathering data and displaying the dashboard:

1) Receiving CTA train-tracker API
2) Parsing API data and transforming into dataframes to be importing into BigQuery
3) Managing BigQuery tables and setting up data loads
4) Building out dash app which takes BigQuery data as inputs
5) Setting up VM in Google Cloud Platform to host data load and dash app
6) Setting up Google Domain and Obtaining SSL Certificate for safe internet traffic

### CTA Train Tracking API

The Chicago Transit Authority provides citizens with live-time data of the CTA Trains currently on the system, in the expressed purpose to "create interesting new applications and mash-ups thatâ€™ll help people get the information they want or need about CTA services". By going to the [CTA API Site](https://www.transitchicago.com/developers/traintracker/) and signing up for a key through the API Key Application Form, the CTA will provide an API Key likely that same day.

### Parsing API Data

The API imports the train location data as an XML file. To parse out the data, we use the BeautifulSoup module to clean up the XML, and the find_all() function to grab each train in the system and loop through its properties, adding the data to a pandas dataframe. 

### Managing BigQuery

Google Cloud Platform provides a data storage service called [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery), which can be used to house the CTA data for effectively no cost (Limits apply to storage and queueing data, but for this app's purpose we don't come near those limits). I have data uploading to two BigQuery tables in this project. One is a snapshot table that truncates (replaces) the current location data of trains, continously updating and feeding the table and figure in my dash app. The second table is an aggregate table that takes data that has been transformed into train-run oriented data - containing the times a certain train passed each station on its route. This table is currently not being used but will hopefully form the base of a predictive model that will estimate train arrival times in a later iteration of the website.

### Building out Dash App
